When generating the shell script, please ensure it adheres to the following best practices to provide a robust and user-friendly experience on Unix/BSD systems:

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling and Input Validation**:
   - Use `set -euo pipefail` at the beginning of the script to catch errors, unset variables, and failed pipes.
   - Validate all input arguments and provide meaningful error messages to guide the user.

2. **Clear and Colorful Output**:
   - Implement clear, user-friendly messages.
   - Use color coding (e.g., bold yellow for warnings) to enhance readability and draw attention to important information.

3. **Detailed Progress Reporting**:
   - Include a function to print each command before executing it for transparency and easier debugging:
     ```bash
     function print_and_execute() {
       echo "+ $@" >&2
       "$@"
     }
     ```
   - This mirrors the output of Bash's `set -x` but offers more control over the output.

4. **Strategic Error Handling with `set -e` and `set +e`**:
   - Enable `set -e` to exit immediately on errors.
   - Use `set +e` strategically within loops or sections where you want the script to continue despite individual command failures.
     ```bash
     set -eo pipefail
     for item in "$@"; do
       set +e
       # Commands that may fail but shouldn't exit the script
       set -e
     done
     ```

5. **Platform-Specific Adaptations**:
   - Detect the operating system and adjust script behavior to ensure consistency across different environments:
     ```bash
     if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then
       TIMEOUT="timeout -v $RUN_TIME_LIMIT"
     else  # Assume macOS
       if [ -x "$(command -v gtimeout)" ]; then
         TIMEOUT="gtimeout -v $RUN_TIME_LIMIT"
       else
         echo -e "${BOLD_YELLOW}WARNING${RESET} gtimeout not available. Install with \`brew install coreutils\`."
       fi
     fi
     ```

6. **Timestamped File Outputs for Multiple Runs**:
   - Implement timestamping to prevent overwriting results and maintain a history:
     ```bash
     filetimestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
     # Use $filetimestamp in your output file names
     ```

7. **Usage Instructions**:
   - Provide a `--help` option that displays detailed usage information and examples.

8. **Comments and Clear Naming**:
   - Use descriptive variable and function names.
   - Include comments to explain complex sections of the code.

9. **Modularity**:
   - Organize the script into functions to improve readability and maintainability.

10. **Enhanced User Experience**:
    - Handle errors gracefully without exposing unnecessary technical details.
    - Avoid assumptions about the user's environment; check for required tools and dependencies, and inform the user if they're missing.
